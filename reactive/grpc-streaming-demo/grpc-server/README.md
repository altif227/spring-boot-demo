# About
This project demonstrates how to write a simple, Java-based grpc server, using the **Spring Framework**. This is actually a Spring Boot application. It uses an in-memory H2 Database as a store. Flyway is used for populating the Database on start-up.

The main class is **GrpcServerApplication**.
